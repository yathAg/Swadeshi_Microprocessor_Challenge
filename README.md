# Swadeshi Microprocessor Challenge


Shelfy aims to provide a more accessible and useful
warehouse automation system that can manage
inventory, storing and retrieving objects, all while
being controlled remotely. This project is specifically
targeted for the Indian market, where small scale
warehouses are plagued with issues like nonstandard stocking techniques, employee errors, and
high cost of maintenance.

<br />

Shelfy is a modular, affordable and smart solution to
resolve these issues and in turn enhances the supply
chain while targeting the multi-billion-dollar
warehousing industry.
